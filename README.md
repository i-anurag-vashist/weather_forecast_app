   - After this, you will receive an API key. The key will be sent to your email and will also be available in your OpenWeatherMap dashboard.

2. **Add Your API Key to the App**:
   - Create a new file named `apiKeys.js` in your project directory.
   - Add your key and the base URL for the OpenWeatherMap API:
     ```javascript
     module.exports = {
       key: "{Your API Key Here}",
       base: "https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/",
     };
     ```
   - Replace `{Your API Key Here}` with the API key you received.
